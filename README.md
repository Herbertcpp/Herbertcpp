## Hi there, my name is Herbert!

Student from Austria and passionate programmer, interested in many different fields though mainly low level programming and networking with C++/Rust.
Gone through many different phases that's why I also know how to code in languages such as GO or Luau.
Check out my repos if you want to and have a great rest of your day :)
